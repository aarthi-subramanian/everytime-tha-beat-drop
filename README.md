# Everytime Tha Beat Drop

### Background

Music streaming services like Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, Deezer contain huge libraries of music. This is great for users who search for songs or artists they like, but is difficult for new music discovery and users can be overwhelmed by the options.

As a result, these companies try to build algorithms or recommenders to provide personal recommendations for new music. 

Here, we'll use data from The Echo Nest, a research group that has complied metadata on millions of tracks. We'll further supplement this dataset with further information on track characteristics. We'll try to leverage all of these attributes to build a few classification models to predict whether a track should be classified as genre "hip-hop" or "rock".

### Key skills
Pandas data manipulation, matplotlib data visualisation, scikit-learn machine learning techniques (e.g. PCA, logistic regression, decision tree, balancing data, k-fold cross-validation)
